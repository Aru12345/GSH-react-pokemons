# Git Scavenger Hunt - React Pokemons

## What is Git Scavenger Hunt (GSH)?

Git Scavenger Hunt (GSH) is an event hosted every Friday by Flatiron School Flex Staff at 11am ET. During this event Flatiron students will pair and work **collaboratively**. At the start of each session the staff will introduce the project that we will be contributing to, and open the session up for questions. Next, students will be sent into different breakout rooms and begin the hunt for issues to fix. During the breakout session students are allowed to ask the hosts for help, using the zoom controls. Lastly, the final minutes will be spent doing a live code review, where staff will look at the incoming pull requests and decide whether to merge or suggest changes.

## Agenda

_Timing may vary depending on each session_

- Introducing Project - 5 mins
- Questions - 5-10 mins
- Scavenging - breakout rooms open - 30 mins
- Live Code Review - 15 mins

# Project Overview

This current project has been repurposed from a previous live lecture. React pokemons is an application that pulls data from the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/). The data is stored in a rails backend created specifically for this project. Follow the instructions at this [repository](https://github.com/Ejguzman3988/rails-poke-backend-test) to set up your server. React Pokemons have a few features that have already been coded in. Some work, while others don't. Most if not all of the code is written in javascript class syntax, which means we will have to convert classes over to using functional components.

# Instructions

## What are we looking for?

Github has an issue feature on every repository. If you are the first to locate an issue with a project that issue will be assigned to you. You will then fork and clone the repository and submit the bug fix via a pull request.

## What is a Pull Request?

Pull requests are way to tell other collaborators about changes you have pushed to your branch on GitHub. Opening a pull request allows the staff to review the potential changes to the base branch. This is why it is more than ever important to write meaningful commit messages in order to explain what your code will do once merged into the main branch.

## How to create an Issue on GitHub?

Navigate to the issue tab and describe your issue. Adding tags will help identify how urgent your issue actually is. It can also help identify what kind of issue it is.
